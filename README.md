I like to go on rabbit holes for pretty much everything. 

This GitHub page is a memorial for all my dead and abandoned projects. And the one project being made that will someday be covered in cobwebs. Rest in pieces and lots of unfixed bugs <3.

Y'all I think I went down the webdev rabbit hole a bit too much...
